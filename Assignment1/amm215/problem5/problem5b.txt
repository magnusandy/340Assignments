Problem 5
PART B)
--See also the function compose3 as the lamda in haskell is used there, but we can formalize using currying the function of compose3 as:

 compose3 = \f.\g.\h.\x.(f(g(h(x)))) f1 f2 f3

compose3 is the lamda expressions above passed its first three parameters
where the f g h are all functions and x is a double parameter and '\' is substituted for the lamda character
